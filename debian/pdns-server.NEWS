pdns (4.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Autosecondary operation is no longer enabled by default, use the
  autosecondary configuration option to enable.

  Bind and SQL backends have a mandatory schema upgrade, please use
  the included SQL files.

  The old init scripts were deprecated and removed, please use the
  systemd units instead. They support multiple instances, but you have
  to set this up again (look for pdns@.service).

pdns (4.0.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  The "bind" backend is no longer included in the pdns-server package, instead
  it is provided in pdns-backend-bind. Users having APT install Recommends
  (the default), will continue to get it installed.  If you are upgrading from
  a previous version and have disabled bindbackend previously, you need to do
  so again, either by uninstalling pdns-backend-bind or by deleting
  /etc/powerdns/pdns.d/bind.conf.

pdns (3.4.6-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  The "geo" backend has been replaced by the much newer "geoip"
  backend. The geoip backend actually has documentation and upstream
  has a higher confidence of keeping it working in newer versions.
